Greetings, Recruitment Team!

I would like to share my work regarding Automation testing for your consideration.
 I have successfully conducted testing across all four potential scenarios, 
 and each test has yielded positive results. Additionally, 
 I have performed thorough cross-browser testing using both Chrome and Edge browsers.

Learnings--
I have learnt about testcafe, earlier i was using Cypress. They are having similar feature.

Encountered Obstacles--
One of the most formidable hurdles in any endeavor is ensuring timely delivery.

Thanks
Sharad Kumar
